# Apple_Homepage_Clone

> This is my first solo project of the HTML/CSS module at microverse.

This repository is setup for a microverse project to practice the use backgrounds and gradients. I was required to clone the actual page [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/). I implemented the nav section as a list which contained all the navigation links. A background gradient was applied to the nav while the entire content-container at the top was given a background image.
